# LUH ZQS Data Literacy Seminar 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/markusstocker/zqs-data-literacy/HEAD?labpath=notebook.ipynb)

In this exercise we use a few data sources to compare SARS-CoV-2 to other infectious diseases using basic data processing and visualization in Python. The exercise is inspired by a 2014 [The Guardian visualization](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/15/visualised-how-ebola-compares-to-other-infectious-diseases) that compared Ebola with other infectious diseases.
